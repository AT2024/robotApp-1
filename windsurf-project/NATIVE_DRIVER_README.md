# Native Mecademic Driver Integration âœ…

## What Was Fixed

The Windsurf Robotics Control Application now uses the **native Mecademic driver** instead of mecademicpy, while maintaining the exact same workflow you're used to.

## How to Run (Same as Before!)

### Development Mode
Just run the `run.bat` file:
```
run.bat
```
- Frontend: http://localhost:3002  
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080

### Production Mode  
```
run-prod.bat
```
- Application: http://localhost

### Manual Docker Commands
```bash
# Development
docker-compose up -d

# Production  
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

## What's New (Native Driver Features)

- **No mecademicpy dependency** - Direct TCP protocol implementation
- **NIC-specific binding** - Optional network interface control
- **Improved performance** - Native connection management  
- **Enhanced reliability** - Better error handling and recovery

## Configuration (Optional)

You can now optionally configure network binding in your environment:

```bash
# Bind to specific network interface (optional)
ROBOTICS_MECA_BIND_INTERFACE=eth0

# Or bind to specific IP (optional)  
ROBOTICS_MECA_BIND_IP=192.168.1.100
```

## Everything Else Unchanged

- âœ… Same frontend UI and functionality
- âœ… Same database and wafer management
- âœ… Same OT-2 and Arduino integration  
- âœ… Same API endpoints and WebSocket communication
- âœ… Same docker-compose workflow

The app works exactly like before, just with better Mecademic control! ðŸš€
